# Tools & Prerequisites

Here is a list of tools, software and libraries that will be used during the workshop.

| Tool | Documentation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| *Code Editor* | | A JavaScript code editor, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended
| *Browser* |  | A modern browser, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended
| *Canvas API* | [[docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)] | The HTML5 `<canvas>` API, built into all browsers 
| *Command-Line* | [[guide](./docs/command-line.md)] | A command-line application like Terminal (macOS) or [cmder](http://cmder.net/) (Windows)
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v8+) | [[docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/)] | Used for running command-line JavaScript tools
| [npm](https://npmjs.com/) (v5+) | [[docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/)] | Used to install third-party dependencies and tools
| [`canvas-sketch`](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/) | [[docs](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/tree/master/docs)] | A development tool & framework for Generative Art
| [`canvas-sketch-util`](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util/) | [[docs](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util/tree/master/docs)] | Utilities for Math & Random Number Generation
| [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) | [[docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)] | A 3D rendering engine for WebGL

If you already have these tools installed, you can use the `--version` flag to make sure you have at least `node@8` and `npm@5`:

```sh
npm --version
node --version
```

### Complete Installation Guide

If you haven't installed these yet, you can find more instructions here:

- [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md)

## Installing `canvas-sketch` CLI

We will be using [`canvas-sketch`](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/) and its command-line interface (CLI) during the workshop.

To install the CLI with npm, use the `--global` or `-g` flag like so:

```sh
npm install canvas-sketch-cli --global
```

> :bulb: Note the `-cli` suffix in the name; this tells npm to install the CLI tool, not the code library.

# Code Snippets

I've also included a small "recipes" document that you can use as a reference if you are forgetting some of the patterns and recipes discussed during the workshop.

- [Code Snippets](./docs/snippets.md)

# Command-Line Tips & Suggestions

If you are new to the command-line, you can read more details here:

- [Command-Line Tips & Suggestions](./docs/command-line.md)

# Cloning & Running Examples

During the workshop, you won't need to clone and run this repository locally. However, if you wish to do so, you can find more instructions here:

- [Cloning & Running Examples](./docs/cloning.md)

# Modules

This workshop encourages students to make use of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) modules to build complex and interesting artworks.

If you find a module you want to use, like [riso-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/riso-colors), you can install it from your project folder like so:

```sh
npm install riso-colors
```

Below are some of the modules used in the workshop:

- [riso-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/riso-colors) - Risograph color palettes
- [paper-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paper-colors) - paper color palettes
- [three-tube-wireframe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-tube-wireframe) - build volumetric wireframes from a THREE.Geometry
- [three-geometry-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-geometry-data) - get nested vertex & normal data from a THREE.Geometry
- [three-quaternion-from-normal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-quaternion-from-normal) - to orient a mesh toward a normal vector

Here's a list of some other modules you might like to use in generative art:

- [load-asset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/load-asset) - a utility to load images and other assets with async/await
- [nice-color-palettes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nice-color-palettes) - a collection of 1000 beautiful color palettes
- [poisson-disk-sampling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poisson-disk-sampling) - can be used for 2D and 3D object placements
- [convex-hull](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-hull) - 2D and 3D convex hull generation
- [delaunay-triangulate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delaunay-triangulate) - 2D and 3D triangulation
- [voronoi-diagram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/voronoi-diagram) - for 2D and 3D voronoi diagrams
- [svg-mesh-3d](https://github.com/mattdesl/svg-mesh-3d) - convert SVG path string to a 3D mesh
- [eases](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eases) - a set of common easing functions
- [glsl-noise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glsl-noise) - noise functions as a GLSL module (used with glslify)
- [glsl-hsl2rgb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glsl-hsl2rgb) - HSL to RGB function as a GLSL module (used with glslify)
